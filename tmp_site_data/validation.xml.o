<p>Xml validation is the process of checking that
an xml document follows the rules for that type
of document.</p>
<p>This validation is essential so that the tools (such as templates)
can operate on the data.  Validating the xml is a good way of
preventing errors later.  These validation rules are written in
some form of formalised language.  Many languages can be used
for this purpose, for example a validation template could be
written in xslt and xpath.  Languages commonly used for validation
include DTD's, XML Schema and RelaxNG.</p>
<p>The choice of validation languages is influenced by the toolsets
in use, company policy and other considerations.  In this case
the choice of <a href="http://relaxng.org/spec-20011203.html">RelaxNG</a>, 
<a href="http://relaxng.org/compact.html">compact syntax</a>, 
was chosen for compatibility
with the emacs editor.  </p>
<p>The relaxng specification for this project is:
<xi:include href="site.rnc" parse="text"/>
