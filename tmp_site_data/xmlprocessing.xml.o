<p>XML processors of which there are three common types, SAX, DOM, XSLT
tokenise an XML document and these tokens are processed by the user application, not the raw text file.</p>
<p>SAX and DOM are libraries that make the content of the XML document
available to a host language such as Java.  DOM is used in conjuction
with JavaScript in AJAX web pages.  XSLT is an XML based language for
processing XML documents.</p>
<p>The API's for each language are different and independent, but they
exhibit strong simiarities.  XSLT is an important part of many XML tool
chains.  It can be used to convert a document (eg docbook) to pdf through
XSLT-FO.  XSLT delegates the interrogation of the XML document to the
XPATH language.</p>
<p>XPATH is also used as an XML interrogation language by XQUERY. XPATH expressions operate on a tree of nodes.  DOM offers such a tree.  An XPATH processor may operate on a DOM tree, or any other representation it chooses.  Proficiency with both XSLT and XQUERY requires a sound proficiency in XPATH.  The node types of an xml document (as defined by XPATH) are:
<ul>

<li>
<p>root nodes</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>element nodes</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>text nodes</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>attribute nodes</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>namespace nodes</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>processing instruction nodes</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>comment nodes</p>
</li>

</ul>
